Description: ==========
        notify-run
        ==========
        
        Setup
        -----
        
        ``notify-run`` can be installed with ``pip``::
        
            pip install notify-run
        
        This will install both a Python module ``notify_run`` for sending notifications
        programmatically, and the ``notify-run`` command for sending notifications
        from the shell.
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        Before you use either the shell command or Python package to send notifications,
        you must configure an endpoint. Both the command-line interface and Python
        interface provide a way of creating this configuration, and the configuration is
        shared by both. The configuration is stored in a file called ``.config/notify-run``
        in your home directory.
        
        Command-line Interface
        ----------------------
        
        Register a channel
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        To register a channel::
        
            notify-run register
        
        You will then be presented with a link that you can open on the devices
        you wish to subscribe to the channel. A QR code encoding the link is also
        provided for convinience.

        Sending Message
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Once you have registered a channel, you can send a message to it with the
        ``send`` subcommand::
        
            notify-run send "Hi from notify-run."
        
        To open a webpage when the notification is clicked, you can pass it to
        notify-run as the `-a` parameter::
        
            notify-run send "Click to open notify.run!" -a https://notify.run
        
        Using an Existing Endpoint
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        If you want to point notify-run at an existing endpoint, for example one
        created through the `web interface <https://notify.run/>`_, you can use the
        ``configure`` subcommand instead of ``register``::
        
            notify-run configure <endpoint URL>
        
        Python Interface
        ----------------
        
        The commands above can also be used through a Python interface::
        
            from notify_run import Notify
            notify = Notify()
            notify.register()
            notify.send('Hi there!')
            notify.send('Click to open notify.run!', 'https://notify.run')
        
        The ``notify.register()`` and ``notify.info()`` commands return an ``EndpointInfo`` object.
        When rendered in a terminal, this prints the QR code in a terminal-friendly way. When used
        in a Jupyter notebook, it displays the QR code inline.
